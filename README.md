# 3D Graphing Calculator

## About
This is a 3D graphing calculator that allows users to plot and visualize 3D mathematical functions in real-time. The calculator provides an interactive interface for creating 3D plots and analyzing mathematical expressions in three-dimensional space.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Plots**: Plot and visualize any mathematical expression in 3D space.
- **Real-Time Graphing**: Modify the function, domain, and range to see the graph update instantly.
- **Multiple Functions**: Support for plotting multiple functions at once for comparison.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Customize colors, grids, and more.
- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom, pan, and rotate the plot for better understanding.

## How to Run
```
//Open a terminal
//Ensure Git is installed

//Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vishwasenthil/3-dgraphingcalc.git

//Navigate to the project directory
cd react-app

//Start the application
npm start

```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the 3D graph by entering a mathematical function. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

Function Input: In the input field, type the mathematical function you want to visualize. For example:

z = x^2 + y^2
z = sin(x) * cos(y)
z = x^3 - 3*x*y^2

Zoom and Rotate: Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out, and click/drag to rotate the graph in 3D space.

Add Multiple Functions: Enter multiple functions to compare them side by side
