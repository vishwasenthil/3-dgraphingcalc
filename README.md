# 3-d graphing calculator 


Hi! We are Team Gengar Gang of Mr. Hong's 6th period Special Topics in CS class. For our project, we decided to build our own 3D graphing calculator. Our main motive behind this are to gain experience with creating visualizations and working with websites. And because available verisons are slow and unintuitive to use, we plan on trying to create our own that works better for us.
